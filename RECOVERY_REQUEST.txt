Hello GitHub Support,

I have lost access to my GitHub account (username: designbymalina) due to removal of the 2FA device. I no longer have the recovery codes or any 2FA device, and I cannot log in via browser.

However, I still have access to this repository via Git from VS Code, and I can commit and push as proof of ownership.

Please help me recover access to my account.

GitHub username: designbymalina

Repo: https://github.com/designbymalina/dbmframework

Thank you.
